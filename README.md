# Exercises-for-programmers

## Chapter 1: <br>
- Understanding the Problem:<br>
One of the best ways to figure out what you have to do is to write it down. If something is not clear, ask! <br>
If you’re ready to open your text editor and hammer out the code, you’re jumping way ahead of yourself. You see, if you don’t take the time to carefully design the program you might end up with something that works but isn’t good quality. <br>
- Discovering Inputs, Processes, and Outputs:<br>
Every program has inputs, processes, and outputs, whether
it’s a simple program like this one or a complex application. For the beginning you can make a block-diagram with the different states. <bt>
- Driving Design with Tests <br>
One of the best ways to design and develop software is to
think about the result you want to get right from the start. <br>
- Writing the Algorith in Pseudocode <br>
There’s no “right way” to write pseudocode, although there
are some widely used terms. You might use Initialize to state
that you’re setting an initial value, Prompt to say that you’re
prompting for input, and Display to indicate what you’re
displaying on the screen.
